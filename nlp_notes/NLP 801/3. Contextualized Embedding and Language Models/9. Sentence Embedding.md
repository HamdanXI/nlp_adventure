Certainly! Let's delve into the concept of sentence embedding and its evolution with the use of models like BERT.

### Sentence Embedding:

- **Purpose**: Sentence embedding is the practice of converting a sentence into a fixed-size vector in an embedding space. The aim is that sentences with similar meanings or contexts should have embeddings that are close to each other in this space.

- **Why not Just Average Word Embeddings?**: One might think that averaging the embeddings of all words in a sentence could be a simple way to obtain a sentence embedding. However, this method has limitations. While averaging non-contextualized word vectors might provide a reasonable representation, it lacks the depth and nuances that a good sentence embedding should capture. For instance, it can't understand word order or relationships between words in the sentence.

### Evaluation on the STS dataset:

- **STS Dataset**: The Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STSb) is a collection of sentence pairs annotated with human-judged similarity scores. The goal is to measure the effectiveness of sentence embedding techniques by comparing the embeddings of two sentences and determining how similar they are.

- **Finding**: When trying to use language models for sentence embeddings, initial attempts did not yield good results. Surprisingly, a simple approach like averaging individual, non-contextualized word vectors sometimes outperformed the complex models.

### Better Sentence Embedding by Reimers and Gurevych (2019):

- **Fine-tuning BERT**: Instead of just using BERT out-of-the-box for sentence embeddings, Reimers and Gurevych proposed fine-tuning BERT specifically to optimize sentence similarity. 

- **Training Data**: They used the STSb dataset to train and evaluate the model. 

- **Objective**: The goal during training was to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the cosine similarity of sentence embeddings produced by BERT and the human-annotated similarity scores.

    - **Cosine Similarity**: This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, resulting in a similarity score between -1 and 1. It's computed as the dot product of the two vectors, normalized by their magnitudes. In the context of sentence embeddings, a high cosine similarity indicates that two sentences are semantically similar, and a low value indicates that they are dissimilar.

### Conclusion:

While initial attempts at sentence embeddings using language models like BERT weren't satisfactory, targeted approaches like that proposed by Reimers and Gurevych showed promise. By fine-tuning the models with specific objectives and using relevant datasets, one can achieve more effective and semantically rich sentence embeddings.
