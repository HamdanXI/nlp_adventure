Certainly! Let's break down the provided information and concepts:

### Contextualization of Word Embeddings:

**Traditional (Static) Word Embeddings:** Initially, word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe provided a fixed representation for each word. This means that a word like "cloud" would always have the same vector representation regardless of its context, making it hard to differentiate between "internet cloud" and "sky cloud".

**Predicting Based on Hidden State:** In modern, context-aware embeddings, the representation of a word (like "cloud") is derived from the hidden state of a neural network at the token position of that word. This hidden state is influenced by the surrounding words in the sentence.

**Understanding Context:** The model learns to represent words in context by trying to predict surrounding tokens. So, in a sentence like "The cloud storage capacity is full," the model understands from the context that "cloud" refers to "internet cloud" and not the "sky cloud."

**Result:** The resulting vector representation is said to be "contextualized" because it captures the meaning of the word "cloud" in that specific context.

### TagLM (Peters et al., 2017):

**Contextualized Embedding using Language Model:** TagLM is a method introduced by Peters et al. in 2017 that leverages a pre-trained language model to obtain contextualized word embeddings.

**Frozen Language Model:** Once the language model is pre-trained, it is used to extract word embeddings from its hidden states. However, during subsequent tasks or training (like Named Entity Recognition or Part-of-Speech tagging), the weights of this language model are kept fixed (or "frozen"). This means that no further training or adjustments are made to the language model, and gradients are not back-propagated through it. This is often done for computational efficiency and to preserve the rich representations learned by the language model during its initial training.

**Advantage:** By using the hidden states of a language model, TagLM can capture deeper syntactic and semantic information about words in context, leading to improved performance in various natural language processing tasks.

### Conclusion:

The shift from static word embeddings to contextualized embeddings was a significant advancement in NLP. Models like TagLM harness the power of language models to create rich, context-aware representations of words, which are crucial for tasks where the meaning of words can change based on their surrounding context.
