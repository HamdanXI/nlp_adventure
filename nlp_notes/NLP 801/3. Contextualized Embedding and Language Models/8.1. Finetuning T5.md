Certainly! Let's dive into how T5 is fine-tuned for various tasks and the idea of treating classification as text generation:

### Finetuning T5:

#### 1. Generation Task:
- **Generate via the Decoder**: For generation tasks like text completion or translation, T5 uses its decoder to generate the output sequence.
  
- **Using the Prior Classifier**: In the case of generation tasks that might have been trained with a certain classification objective in mind, T5 doesn't require a separate new classification layer. The model can simply generate the desired output based on the training it has undergone.

#### 2. Classification Task:
- **Convert to Generation**: This is where T5 stands out. Instead of treating classification in the traditional way (predicting a label from a set of classes), T5 treats it as a text generation problem. It generates the label as if it were any other piece of text.
  
- **No Additional Classifier Layer Needed**: Since the model is now treating classification as a text generation problem, there's no need for a separate classification layer. The decoder generates the class label as a piece of text.

### Classification as Text Generation:

- **Model Freedom**: Even though T5 is generating labels as text, it's not constrained to generating only valid labels. It could, in theory, generate any sequence of tokens.

- **Handling Invalid Labels**: If T5 generates a label that doesn't match any valid class label from the set, the original approach in the T5 paper considers it an incorrect answer.

- **Perplexity-based Solution**: A more refined approach to choosing the generated label is to calculate the perplexity of all potential label generations and select the one with the lowest perplexity. 
  - **Perplexity** is a measure of how well the probability distribution predicted by the model aligns with the actual distribution of the words in the text. A lower perplexity indicates a better fit.
  - The given formula for perplexity, $\text{Perplexity}(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{N} \sum \log P(x_{t+1} | x_0 \dots x_t)\right)$, is a standard way to compute it. In this formula, $P(x_{t+1} | x_0 \dots x_t)$ is the model's predicted probability of the next word given the words it has seen so far, and $N$ is the total number of words.

### Conclusion:

The innovative approach of T5 to treat both generation and classification tasks as text generation problems simplifies the fine-tuning process. Instead of adding new layers or making significant architectural changes for different tasks, T5 can be adapted to various tasks by altering its training objectives and utilizing its text generation capabilities.
