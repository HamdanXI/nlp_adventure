## Better Way to Pass Information:

When processing sequences, especially in natural language processing tasks, the goal is to effectively and efficiently pass information through the network. For instance, in sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, the start of the sentence might significantly influence the end of the sentence, and vice versa.

#### Issues with the Standard Approach:

- **O(N) Connection**: This indicates that the time it takes to pass information is linear to the length of the sequence. In longer sequences, this can be inefficient.
  
- **O(N) Complexity**: This implies the process cannot be easily parallelized, making it computationally expensive for longer sequences.

### The Given Sentence: 

"Keren orang itu" translates to "that person is cool" in English.

- Here, "Keren" is "cool", "orang" is "person", and "itu" is "that".

### Direct Connection of Hidden States by Averaging:

To improve efficiency, one can think of connecting hidden states directly by averaging them. This method would condense the information from various states into a single representation.

- **Mean Pooling**: This is a technique where you take the average of the hidden states to get a fixed-size vector that represents the entire sequence. The idea is to condense the entire sequence's information into a singular representation.

### Weighted Average:

Instead of treating every hidden state with equal importance, a weighted average considers the context and assigns varying weights to different states.

- In the given sentence, since "that" translates to "itu", a weighted average mechanism would assign more weight to "itu" when trying to predict or understand "that".

#### Benefits:

- **Dynamic Importance Assignment**: Rather than treating all words or tokens in the sequence equally, the network determines which tokens are more crucial based on context.
  
- **Efficiency**: By focusing on more critical parts of the sequence, the network can potentially reduce the complexity of processing less-relevant parts.

### Hypothetical Example:

"the cat slept because it..."

- In this example, understanding what "it" refers to depends on the context. Here, "it" likely refers to "the cat". In sequences, understanding such dependencies and context is vital. A mechanism that assigns weighted importance based on context can better handle such dependencies.

### Summary:

While linear connections (O(N)) in sequence processing are straightforward, they might not be the most efficient. Techniques like mean pooling and weighted averaging can potentially condense sequence information more effectively. However, the challenge lies in dynamically determining weights based on context to capture essential dependencies within the sequence.
