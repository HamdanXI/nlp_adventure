### **Encoder-Only Transformer**:

In the original Transformer model, there are two main parts: the encoder and the decoder. Each of these parts consists of multiple identical layers stacked on top of each other. While the encoder processes the input sequence and compresses this information, the decoder generates the output sequence based on the context provided by the encoder.

However, for many tasks other than sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, we don't need the decoder part. Instead, we only use the encoder part. Such a model is called an "encoder-only" Transformer.

#### **Applications**:
1. **Sentence Embeddings**: If we need a fixed-size representation (embedding) of a sentence, paragraph, or document, we can pass the input through the encoder and take the final hidden state as the representation.
  
2. **Classification Tasks**: For tasks like sentiment analysis, where the goal is to classify an input sequence into categories, the encoder's output can be pooled (e.g., averaged or max-pooled) to get a fixed-size representation, which can then be passed to a classifier.

3. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: One of the most famous encoder-only models is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus by predicting masked words in a sentence. After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on a specific task using a smaller labeled dataset.

#### **Working**:
1. **Input Embeddings**: The input sequence is first converted into embeddings. These embeddings are vector representations of input tokens.

2. **Positional Encodings**: Since Transformer doesn't have a built-in sense of order or position, positional encodings are added to the embeddings to give the model information about the position of words in a sequence.

3. **Multiple Encoder Layers**: The input then passes through multiple encoder layers. Each encoder layer has two main parts: 
    - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence to capture relationships between words, regardless of their distance from each other.
    - **Feed-forward Neural Network**: Each attention output is passed through a feed-forward network (the same one for each position).

4. **Residual Connections and Normalization**: After each sub-layer (self-attention and feed-forward), there's a residual connection followed by layer normalization. This helps in stabilizing the activations and speeds up training.

5. **Output**: The output of the final encoder layer can be used as the representation of the input sequence. For classification tasks, this output can be pooled or the final hidden state of a special token (e.g., [CLS] in BERT) can be used to get a fixed-size vector, which is then passed to a classifier.

In summary, an encoder-only Transformer processes an input sequence and provides a contextualized representation of it without the need for decoding. This architecture has proven to be highly effective for a wide range of NLP tasks, as showcased by models like BERT.
