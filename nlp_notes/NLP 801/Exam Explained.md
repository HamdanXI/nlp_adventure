### Isn't BERT, ELMO, and RoBERTa encoder-based models while Word2Vec and GloVe are ways to transfer text to vector? Are they related?

Yes, you're right in noting distinctions, but they are all related in the broader scope of converting words or sentences into dense vector representations. Let's clarify:

1. **BERT, ELMO, and RoBERTa**: These are deep learning models, primarily based on transformer architectures, designed to produce contextualized word embeddings. They consider the surrounding context of a word in a sentence to produce its embedding. For instance, in the sentence "I live near the bank of America," the word 'bank' would be represented differently than in "I need to withdraw money from the bank."

2. **Word2Vec and GloVe**: These models produce static word embeddings, meaning each word has a single, fixed vector representation irrespective of its context in a sentence. They are trained on large corpora to capture semantic relationships between words based on co-occurrence statistics. While they can capture certain semantic and syntactic relationships between words, they do not produce context-dependent embeddings like BERT or ELMO.

The relation is that all these models aim to convert words or sequences into dense vectors, but they differ in how they achieve this. BERT, ELMO, and RoBERTa capture context-sensitive information, while Word2Vec and GloVe give context-agnostic, fixed representations.

### But BERT, ELMO and RoBERTa are encoder based models right?

Yes, BERT, ELMO, and RoBERTa are indeed based on encoder mechanisms, each with unique characteristics:

1. **ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)** uses a BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) architecture as its encoder. It generates embeddings by processing the text data in both directions (forward and backward) to capture contextual information. This bidirectional processing is fundamental to ELMo's ability to understand the meaning of a word in the context of its surrounding text.

2. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** employs the Transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to compute contextualized word embeddings. Unlike sequence-to-sequence models (which use both encoders and decoders), BERT only utilizes the encoder stack of the Transformer model. Its bidirectionality allows it to capture complex context from both the left and the right of each word during the pre-training process.

3. **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)** is built on BERTâ€™s architecture but optimizes it by adjusting the training procedure, including removing the Next Sentence Prediction objective, modifying the masking pattern for training, and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.

These models are considered "encoders" in that they process input sequences (of tokens or words) and convert them into intermediate, contextualized representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used in various downstream NLP tasks, without the need for a corresponding "decoder." The primary goal of these encoder-based models is to capture the nuanced context of words within their surrounding text, which they achieve through different architectures and mechanisms, but all under the broad umbrella of "encoding" language into a meaningful representation.
