### Language Models as Contextualized Embedding
   
   Traditional word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe represent words with a fixed embedding regardless of the context in which the word appears. This means that the word "bank" will have the same vector representation whether it appears in the context of a riverbank or a financial institution.

   Contrastingly, newer language models (like BERT, GPT, etc.) generate what we call "contextualized embeddings". This means that the embedding (or representation) of a word is dependent on its surrounding context. The word "bank" will have a different representation when talking about rivers compared to when talking about money, which helps in better understanding and capturing the nuances of natural language.

### Causal Language Models (e.g., GPT)

   Causal Language Models (CLMs) like GPT are trained in a way that they predict the next word/token in a sequence based on the previous words/tokens. This "causal" or "autoregressive" nature means they generate text in a sequential manner, always trying to predict the next most probable word. Because of this, they are particularly well-suited for tasks like text generation.

### Generating Text via Large Language Models (LLM)

   Text generation using a LLM (like GPT) typically follows these steps:

   a. **Initialization**: Start with an initial prompt or seed text. If you donâ€™t provide one, the model might start with a generic or random one.
   
   b. **Token Prediction**: Based on the given prompt, the model predicts the next most probable token. This prediction is based on the patterns and structures the model has learned during its training phase.
   
   c. **Append and Continue**: The predicted token is added to the original text, and then this combined text is fed back into the model for predicting the subsequent token.
   
   d. **Stopping Criteria**: This loop continues until a specified maximum length is reached or another stopping condition is met (like the model generating an end-of-sentence token).
   
   e. **Sampling and Temperature**: During generation, randomness can be introduced to make outputs more diverse. By adjusting parameters like "temperature", you can influence the randomness. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) means more randomness and diversity, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) makes the generation more deterministic and focused on the most probable next token.
   
   f. **Beam Search**: Instead of just considering the next single most probable token, beam search expands upon a set number of the most probable sequences. It can improve the quality of the generated text but might also make the output more generic.

Text generation with LLMs has been popularized due to the quality of the generated content and its applications in chatbots, story generators, content creation, and more.
