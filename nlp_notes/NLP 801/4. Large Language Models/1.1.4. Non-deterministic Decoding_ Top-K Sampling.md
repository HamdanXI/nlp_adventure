**Non-deterministic Decoding: Top-K Sampling**:

Top-K sampling is another non-deterministic decoding strategy used to introduce randomness into sequence generation. In this method, instead of considering the entire vocabulary for the next possible token, only the top K most probable tokens are considered. One of these K tokens is then randomly sampled based on their probabilities to be the next token in the sequence.

This method strikes a balance between purely random sampling (which can sometimes produce very unlikely or nonsensical tokens) and deterministic methods like greedy decoding. By narrowing the sampling pool to the top K tokens, the model is more likely to produce coherent outputs while still maintaining diversity.

**Example**:

Imagine you're using a language model to complete the sentence:

"Elephants are known for their ___."

Given this input, the model predicts the following probabilities for the next words (out of a vastly simplified vocabulary):

- memory: 0.4
- size: 0.35
- trunks: 0.2
- speed: 0.04
- color: 0.01

If you set K = 3 for Top-K sampling, you'd only consider the top 3 tokens: "memory", "size", and "trunks".

Now, based on their probabilities:
- 40% of the time, you might select "memory".
- 35% of the time, you might choose "size".
- 25% of the time, you might opt for "trunks".

Thus, the sentence could be completed as:
- "Elephants are known for their memory."
- "Elephants are known for their size."
- "Elephants are known for their trunks."

By using Top-K sampling, you've excluded very unlikely completions like "color" or "speed" but still allowed for diverse outputs among the most probable tokens.

One potential pitfall of strict Top-K sampling is that setting a fixed K might not always be ideal for all contexts. In some situations, many tokens might have similar probabilities, and limiting to a fixed K might be too restrictive. In other situations, only a few tokens might have high probabilities, making a larger K too permissive. To address this, methods like Top-p (nucleus) sampling have been introduced, which offer a more dynamic approach to sampling based on cumulative probabilities.
