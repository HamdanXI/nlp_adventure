Sure! When we talk about converting conventional NLP tasks into prompts for models like the GPT series, we're essentially converting structured tasks into more freeform, natural language-based interactions. Here's a breakdown of the points you provided:

### 1. No Need to Manually Write Every Possible Dataset; Somewhat Scalable:

Converting a conventional task into a prompt means that you're creating a template to guide the model's interaction with data. Once you have a template, you can process a vast amount of similar data without manual intervention for each entry.

**Example**:
* **Task**: Sentiment Analysis
* **Original Dataset**: 
  - "I love this song." -> Positive
  - "This is boring." -> Negative
* **Prompt Template**: "What is the sentiment of the sentence: '{Sentence}'?"
* **Converted Dataset**:
  - "What is the sentiment of the sentence: 'I love this song'?"
  - "What is the sentiment of the sentence: 'This is boring'?"

By creating one prompt template, you can convert countless data entries.

### 2. Diverse in Terms of Task Coverage:

Prompt-based training allows you to handle a wide range of tasks using a similar approach, making it versatile.

**Examples**:
* Sentiment analysis: "Determine the sentiment of this text: '{Text}'."
* Translation: "Translate the following English text to Spanish: '{Text}'."
* Summarization: "Provide a brief summary of the paragraph: '{Paragraph}'."

### 3. Not Diverse in Terms of Prompt:

While the tasks can be diverse, the structure of the prompts might be repetitive or limited, as they follow the defined templates.

**Example**:
For sentiment analysis, you might always start with: "Determine the sentiment of this text:". This repetitiveness can make the model overly reliant on specific phrasings.

### 4. Short Answer, Most of the Time:

Prompt-based tasks often expect concise and direct answers.

**Example**:
* **Prompt**: "What is the capital of France?"
* **Expected Answer**: "Paris"

Such interactions tend to have brief and specific responses.

### 5. Not So Great for Open-Ended Prompts:

While prompt-based models can handle a variety of tasks, they might not excel at producing detailed, open-ended narratives or explanations. This is because the prompt structure usually guides the model towards specific, concise outputs.

**Example**:
* **Prompt**: "Describe the universe."
  
The model might provide a basic response like "The universe is vast and contains galaxies, stars, and planets." But it might not delve into a comprehensive exploration unless guided with more detailed or sequenced prompts.

### In Summary:

Converting conventional NLP tasks into prompts provides a scalable and diverse way to handle various tasks. However, the approach might lack diversity in prompt phrasing and may not always be suited for open-ended or detailed responses. When designing prompt-based tasks, it's essential to consider the intended output's depth and complexity.
