Certainly! Let's break down the process of building an instruction dataset from existing NLP datasets using manual templates. This is a common practice, especially with models like GPT-series where the model is given an instruction to carry out a task.

### 1. What is an Instruction Dataset?

An instruction dataset is designed to provide context and guide a language model in performing specific tasks. Instead of simply presenting the model with raw data, you give it an "instruction" or a "prompt" to set the stage for what you want the model to do.

### 2. Gathering Existing NLP Datasets:

Start by collecting one or multiple existing NLP datasets suitable for your needs. For this explanation, let's consider three hypothetical NLP datasets:

- **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: Contains sentences and their sentiment labels (e.g., Positive, Negative).
- **Translation Dataset**: Pairs of sentences in English and French.
- **Question Answering Dataset**: Passages of text with questions and their corresponding answers.

### 3. Manually Convert Using Templates:

Now, for each dataset, design a template that will convert data entries into instructional prompts.

#### Examples:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**:
   
   **Original Entry**:
   ```
   Sentence: "I love this movie!"
   Label: Positive
   ```

   **Template**: "Determine the sentiment of the following sentence: '{Sentence}'."

   **Instructional Prompt**:
   ```
   Determine the sentiment of the following sentence: "I love this movie!"
   Expected Response: Positive
   ```

2. **Translation Dataset**:

   **Original Entry**:
   ```
   English: "Hello, how are you?"
   French: "Bonjour, comment ça va?"
   ```

   **Template**: "Translate the following English sentence to French: '{English}'."

   **Instructional Prompt**:
   ```
   Translate the following English sentence to French: "Hello, how are you?"
   Expected Response: "Bonjour, comment ça va?"
   ```

3. **Question Answering Dataset**:

   **Original Entry**:
   ```
   Passage: "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system."
   Question: "What is the largest planet in our solar system?"
   Answer: "Jupiter"
   ```

   **Template**: "Based on the passage, answer the question: Passage: '{Passage}' Question: '{Question}'."

   **Instructional Prompt**:
   ```
   Based on the passage, answer the question: Passage: "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system." Question: "What is the largest planet in our solar system?"
   Expected Response: "Jupiter"
   ```

### 4. Scaling the Process:

While the above examples show manual conversion for individual data entries, in practice, you'd automate this process. Write a script or code that applies your templates to each entry in the original dataset, producing a new dataset filled with instructional prompts.

### 5. Significance:

- **Guided Training**: By converting datasets into instructional prompts, you provide a clearer context for models, potentially improving their understanding and performance on specific tasks.
  
- **Flexibility**: This method allows you to adapt various datasets for models that rely on prompt-based interactions, like GPT-series models.
  
- **Task Aggregation**: With instructional datasets, you can train a single model on multiple tasks by providing instructions for each task, leading to more versatile models.

When designing your templates, make sure they are clear and unambiguous to ensure the model understands the task you want it to perform.
