The term "prompting black magic" is a colloquial way of describing the sometimes arcane and non-intuitive art of crafting prompts to get desired outputs from language models, especially models like those in the GPT series.

The idea behind this phrase is that getting the right output from a model is not just about feeding it input but about "prompting" it in the right way. Crafting these prompts can sometimes feel more like an art than a science, requiring a mix of intuition, trial and error, and a deep understanding of how the model might think.

### Examples:

1. **Vague Prompting**:
   
   **Input**: "Tell me about apples."
   
   **Output**: "Apples are a type of fruit that come in various colors including red, green, and yellow. They are grown in orchards and are used in many dishes like pies and tarts."

   While this provides a generic answer, it might not be what the user is specifically looking for.

2. **Specific Prompting**:
   
   **Input**: "Explain the nutritional benefits of apples."
   
   **Output**: "Apples are a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin C. They also contain polyphenols, which can have numerous health benefits. Apples are low in calories and can be a part of a healthy diet, aiding in weight management and digestive health."

   Here, by being more specific in our prompt, we guide the model to a more targeted and informative answer.

3. **Prompt Engineering for Challenges**:
   
   During OpenAI's Codex challenge, where the model was supposed to write code, specific prompts were necessary to get the desired output. Instead of saying "Write a function", better results were often achieved with more structured prompts, specifying input types, output types, and giving a clear problem statement.

### Why is it called "Black Magic"?

- **Non-intuitive Results**: Sometimes, very slight changes in the prompt can yield drastically different results from the model. This non-linearity can feel mysterious, hence the term "black magic."
  
- **Requires Experimentation**: There isn't always a clear-cut formula for what will make the perfect prompt. It often requires multiple iterations and experiments to land on the most effective phrasing.

- **Model's Internal Representations**: Models like GPT-3 have their own vast internal representations of the world and language. Interfacing with these representations effectively can feel like trying to cast the right "spell."

### In Summary:

"Prompting black magic" captures the often unpredictable and experimental nature of crafting effective prompts for language models. As models continue to evolve and our understanding deepens, the process may become more transparent and less "magical." But for now, it remains a blend of art and science.
