**Non-deterministic Decoding: Nucleus (Top-P) Sampling**:

Nucleus sampling, also known as Top-P sampling, is a non-deterministic decoding method which, instead of sampling from the top K most probable tokens (as in Top-K sampling), samples from the smallest group of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a predefined threshold P. The threshold P is typically a value between 0 and 1. The aim is to dynamically determine the number of tokens to consider based on the model's confidence in its predictions.

By selecting a subset of tokens based on cumulative probability rather than a fixed number, nucleus sampling offers a more adaptive approach, ensuring diversity in the generated text while still being grounded in the model's predictions.

**Example**:

Imagine you're using a language model to predict the next word in the sentence:

"The sky is ___."

Given this input, the model predicts the following probabilities for the next words (from a simplified vocabulary):

- blue: 0.5
- clear: 0.25
- cloudy: 0.15
- dark: 0.05
- vast: 0.03
- endless: 0.02

Let's say you set a threshold P = 0.7 for nucleus sampling. This means you'd keep adding the most probable words until their combined probability exceeds 0.7.

In this case:
- blue + clear = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 (This exceeds 0.7)

So, you'd consider only "blue" and "clear" for sampling.

Based on their probabilities:
- 67% (or 0.5/0.75) of the time, you might select "blue".
- 33% (or 0.25/0.75) of the time, you might choose "clear".

The sentence could be completed as:
- "The sky is blue."
- "The sky is clear."

The dynamic nature of nucleus sampling means the number of tokens considered can vary depending on the context. If the model is very confident about its top predictions (high probabilities for a few tokens), fewer tokens might be included in the sampling set. Conversely, if the model is uncertain and many tokens have similar, moderate probabilities, then more tokens might be included, ensuring diversity in the output.

Nucleus sampling tends to produce more coherent and diverse results than pure random sampling and can be more contextually adaptive than fixed Top-K sampling.
