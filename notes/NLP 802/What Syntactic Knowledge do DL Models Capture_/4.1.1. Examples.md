Let's apply the Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) rules to the sentence "Kim loves Sandy".

For simplicity, let's assign the following categories:

1. "Kim" and "Sandy" are noun phrases: **NP**
2. "loves" is a transitive verb that expects a noun phrase to its right and another to its left to form a sentence: **(S\NP)/NP**

Now, let's derive the sentence step by step:

**1. Starting Sentence**: 
```
Kim       loves       Sandy
NP        (S\NP)/NP   NP
```

**2. Forward Application (>):** 
The verb "loves" with category **(S\NP)/NP** takes "Sandy" (an **NP**) as its argument to the right.
Result: 
```
loves Sandy
S\NP
```

**3. Backward Application (<):** 
Now, the derived category **S\NP** from "loves Sandy" takes "Kim" (an **NP**) as its argument to the left.
Result:
```
Kim loves Sandy
S
```

Explanation:

- We first combined "loves" with "Sandy" using Forward Application because the verb "loves" looks for a noun phrase to its right. 
- Next, the combined unit "loves Sandy" is looking for a noun phrase to its left (that's why it has the category **S\NP**). It finds "Kim" and they combine using Backward Application to form a sentence **S**.

Thus, "Kim loves Sandy" is a well-formed sentence (category **S**) in our CCG analysis.
