## Specific Combinatory Rules

In the context of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), these terms refer to specific combinatory rules that dictate how categories can combine with each other to generate syntactic derivations. Here's a breakdown of each:

1. **Forward and Backward Application**:
   - **Forward Application (>):** Given two categories, where one is a function that takes the second as its argument to its right, they combine to produce the function's result.
     Example: If we have a verb like "sleeps" with category (S\NP) and a noun phrase "John" with category NP, forward application allows them to combine to form a sentence S: "John sleeps".
   - **Backward Application (<):** It's the reverse of forward application. A function takes an argument to its left.
     Example: A verb like "seen" with category (NP\S) can combine with a noun phrase "has" with category (S/NP) to its left using backward application.

2. **Forward and Backward Composition**:
   - **Forward Composition (>>):** Allows two functions to combine even if one doesn't directly take the other as an argument. Instead, their functions compose.
     Example: If we have a category A/B looking for an argument B and a category B/C looking for an argument C, they can combine to produce a category A/C.
   - **Backward Composition (<<):** It's the reverse of forward composition, working from right to left.

3. **(Generalized Weak) Permutation**:
   - This is a rule that allows two adjacent constituents to swap their order under certain conditions. It's particularly useful in languages or constructions where word order is relatively free, allowing the grammar to generate multiple word orders from a single set of categories.

4. **Type Raising**:
   - This rule changes the type of a category to turn it into a function that looks for another function as its argument. It's a way of introducing function-argument structures where they wouldn't naturally exist.
     Example: A noun phrase "John" with category NP can be type-raised to a category (S/(S\NP)) or ((S/NP)\S), which essentially turns it into a function looking for a verb phrase to combine with.

These rules, in combination with the lexical categories assigned to words, allow CCG to generate a wide range of syntactic structures. They provide the grammar with the flexibility to account for various linguistic phenomena across different languages.
