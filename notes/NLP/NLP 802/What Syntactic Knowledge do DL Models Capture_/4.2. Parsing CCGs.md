## Parsing CCGs

When parsing sentences using Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG), the goal is to assign the correct syntactic and semantic structures based on the categories and combinatory rules. One efficient way to parse with CCGs is to use techniques similar to shift-reduce parsing. Let's dive into the components you've mentioned:

1. **Parsing CCGs**:
   Parsing is the process of assigning a syntactic structure to a given sentence. In CCGs, this involves assigning categories to each word and then determining how these categories combine to produce larger structures, such as phrases and complete sentences.

2. **Shift**:
   The "shift" operation involves moving (or shifting) the next word from the input queue (usually representing the yet-to-be-parsed portion of the sentence) to the top of the stack, along with its associated CCG category. This step essentially prepares the word for potential combination with other words/categories already on the stack.

3. **Reduce**:
   The "reduce" operation involves combining the categories of the top two cells of the stack based on the CCG rules (like application, composition, etc.). If they can combine according to the rules of the grammar, they are merged into a single cell with the resulting category. 

4. **Supertagger**:
   A supertagger is a tool or model that is trained to assign (or "tag") each word in a sentence with its most likely CCG category based on its context within the sentence. Since words can have multiple possible categories, using a supertagger can greatly speed up the parsing process by narrowing down the choices, thus reducing the search space.

5. **Classifier**:
   In the context of a shift-reduce parser, the classifier's job is to decide, at each step, which action (shift, reduce, or possibly others) to take next. It selects the correct parse action based on the current state of the stack, the remaining input, and potentially other features. Machine learning models, especially deep learning ones, have become popular choices for building such classifiers in recent years.

In practice, when parsing a sentence using CCG:

- The **supertagger** initially proposes potential categories for each word.
- The **shift-reduce parser** then uses its **classifier** to decide at each step whether to shift the next word onto the stack or to reduce the top items on the stack.
- This continues until the input queue is empty and the stack contains a single category representing the entire sentence.

The combination of supertagging and shift-reduce parsing allows for efficient and accurate CCG parsing, making it feasible to process large corpora or to use CCG in real-time applications.
