**What is the assumption of a word-document matrix?**
We make the bold conjecture that words that are related will often appear in the same documents. For instance, banks, bonds and stocks are probably likely to appear together. But banks, octopus and hockey would probably not consistently appear together.

**How is a word-document matrix built?**
Loop over billions of documents and for each time word i appears in document j add one to entry Xij.

**What is the issue of a word-document matrix?**
A very large matrix that scales with the number of documents.
