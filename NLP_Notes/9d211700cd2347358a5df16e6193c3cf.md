2.1. Word Embedding

## Word Embedding

Word embedding is a type of word representation that captures semantic information about words in a dense vector format, as opposed to the traditional sparse vector format. Essentially, word embeddings map words or phrases to vectors of real numbers. Here are some key points about word embeddings:

**1. Continuous Representation:** Instead of representing words as one-hot encoded vectors (where every word is a unique sparse vector with a dimension equal to the size of the vocabulary), word embeddings represent words in a continuous vector space.

**2. Semantic Meaning:** Words that have similar meanings tend to be closer to each other in the embedding space. For example, the vectors for "cat" and "kitten" might be close in the vector space, reflecting their semantic similarity.

**3. Dimensionality Reduction:** The dimensionality of the word embeddings is much smaller than the dimensionality of one-hot encoded vectors. Common dimensions for embeddings are 50, 100, 200, or 300, whereas a one-hot encoded vector might have a dimensionality in the tens or hundreds of thousands.

**4. Pre-trained Models:** There are various methods and algorithms to derive word embeddings, and some models, like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, have been pre-trained on massive datasets and can be used directly, giving a head start in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

**5. Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained embeddings can be used as a starting point for other NLP tasks. They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or used as-is.

**6. Mathematical Operations:** An interesting property of word embeddings is that they allow for mathematical operations that can capture semantic relationships. A classic example is the vector arithmetic: vector("king") - vector("man") + vector("woman") â‰ˆ vector("queen").

**7. Methods to Obtain:** Word embeddings can be obtained using various algorithms, the most famous ones being:
- Word2Vec: Developed by a team led by Tomas Mikolov at Google. Word2Vec uses shallow neural networks to produce word vectors. It has two main training algorithms: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram.
- GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation): Developed by researchers at Stanford, it produces word vectors by factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix.
- FastText: Developed at Facebook, this method is an extension of Word2Vec. It takes into account sub-word information (n-grams of characters), making it especially good for morphologically rich languages.

**8. Challenges:** Despite their usefulness, word embeddings have limitations. They don't handle polysemy (words with multiple meanings) very well. A single embedding for a word like "bank" can't capture its different meanings (a financial institution vs. the side of a river).

With the evolution of deep learning in NLP, newer models like BERT and its variants have introduced contextual embeddings, where word representations are influenced by their context, allowing for a more nuanced word representation. However, traditional word embeddings remain a foundational concept in the field.
