1.1. One-hot vector, a na√Øve approach (denotational semantics)

**What is one-hot word representation?**
Every word is represented as a V-dimensional vector (where V is the size of the vocabulary), with all 0s and 1 at the index of that word in the sorted English language.

**What is denotational semantics?**
The concept of representing an idea as a symbol. It is sparse and cannot capture similarity.

**What is the issue of one-hot encoding?**
No notion of similarity (no cosine similarity for instance).
