1.2.2. Window-based co-occurrence matrix

**What is a window-based co-occurrence matrix?**
A matrix stores co-occurrences of words thereby becoming an affinity matrix. In this method, we count the number of times each word appears inside a window of a particular size around the word of interest.

**How to extract word vectors from a word-word co-occurrence matrix?**
Generate a VxV co-occurrence matrix X. Apply SVD on X. Select the first k columns of U to get a k-dimensional word vectors. The ratio of the variances indicates the amount of variance captured by the first k dimensions.

**What are the problems faced with such a method?**
- The dimensions of the matrix change very often
- The matrix is sparse
- Very high dimensional
- Quadratic cost to train
