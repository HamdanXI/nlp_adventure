2.5. Semantic Relationship

## Word Embedding: Semantic Relationship

Word embeddings represent words as vectors in a continuous vector space, in which the position of a word is learned from its context in a large amount of text. One of the most remarkable properties of these embeddings is their ability to capture semantic relationships between words. Let's delve into what this means.

### Semantic Relationships:

The main idea behind word embeddings is that words that appear in similar contexts will have similar meanings. When we say "context," we're referring to the surrounding words. For example, in the sentences "I drink water" and "She sips water", the context around the word "water" is similar, suggesting that the word has a consistent meaning in both sentences.

Once trained, these word embeddings can exhibit some amazing properties:

1. **Linear Relationships**: Word embeddings often reflect linear relationships in the semantic space. For example, using embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe, if you take the vector for "king", subtract the vector for "man", and add the vector for "woman", you'll get a vector that's very close to "queen". Mathematically, this can be represented as:  

$$
\text{king} - \text{man} + \text{woman} \approx \text{queen}
$$

   This example captures a gender relationship, but similar arithmetic can be used to find plural forms of words, verb tenses, and more.

2. **Similarity**: Words with similar meanings tend to be closer in the embedding space. This closeness is often measured using cosine similarity.

3. **Analogies**: Beyond the "king-man+woman=queen" type, other relationships like country-capital, verb tense, and more can be identified. For example:

$$
\text{Spain} - \text{Madrid} + \text{Germany} \approx \text{Berlin}
$$

4. **Hierarchical Relationships**: Word embeddings can sometimes reflect hierarchical information. Words like "poodle" and "dog" might be close in vector space, and "dog" might be closer to "mammal" than "fish".

### Challenges:

While word embeddings are powerful, they also come with challenges:

1. **Bias**: Word embeddings can inadvertently capture societal biases present in the training data. For example, biases related to gender, race, or other factors might get reflected in the embeddings.

2. **Ambiguity**: Words with multiple meanings might be represented in a way that doesn't distinctly capture all of its meanings. For instance, "bank" (financial institution) and "bank" (side of a river) have different meanings, but there's only one vector for "bank".

3. **Static Nature**: Traditional word embeddings do not change based on sentence context. This means that even if "bank" is used in different contexts in different sentences, the word embedding remains the same. Newer models, like BERT, address this issue by producing context-sensitive embeddings.

### Conclusion:

Word embeddings have revolutionized the way machines understand and process human language by capturing semantic relationships in a dense vector space. The relationships they capture can be very intuitive and reflect many nuances of human language, making them invaluable for many natural language processing tasks.
