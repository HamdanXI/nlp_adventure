2.6. Evaluation

## Word Embedding Evaluation

Evaluating word embeddings is crucial to understanding their quality and suitability for specific tasks. Evaluation methods can generally be categorized into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic.

### 1. **Intrinsic Evaluation**:
In intrinsic evaluation, embeddings are evaluated directly based on the properties they capture. Common methods include:

- **Word Similarity and Relatedness Tasks**: In these tasks, human-annotated datasets, containing pairs of words with similarity or relatedness scores, are used. The cosine similarity between embeddings of word pairs is computed, and this is then compared with the human-annotated scores. Commonly used datasets include WordSim-353, SimLex-999, and MEN.

- **Analogy Tasks**: Here, embeddings are tested on word analogy questions like "a is to b as c is to ?". For example, "man is to woman as king is to ?". A correct embedding might predict "queen" for this analogy. The Google analogy test set is a popular dataset for this kind of evaluation.

- **Visualization**: Techniques like t-SNE or PCA are employed to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings and visualize them in 2D or 3D space. By visualizing, one can inspect if semantically similar words cluster together.

### 2. **Extrinsic Evaluation**:
In extrinsic evaluation, the quality of embeddings is assessed based on their performance in downstream tasks. Essentially, you use the embeddings as input features for a specific application and measure how well they perform. This evaluation method provides a practical measure of the utility of embeddings. Common tasks include:

- **Text Classification**: Embeddings can be used as features for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic categorization.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Evaluating how well embeddings help in recognizing named entities (like person names, organizations) in text.

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Using embeddings to help determine the grammatical category of words in a sentence.

- **Machine Translation**: Checking the performance improvement in translation tasks when using certain embeddings.

- **Question Answering**: Assessing the effectiveness of embeddings in answering questions based on provided contexts.

### Challenges in Evaluation:

- **Task Dependency**: The best embeddings for one task may not be the best for another. For example, embeddings optimized for word similarity might not necessarily perform best in machine translation.

- **Size and Quality of Training Data**: The quality of the embeddings is largely dependent on the data they were trained on. If an embedding was trained on biased or limited data, its performance might be suboptimal.

- **Hyperparameters and Training Choices**: Different choices in the training process, such as window size, embedding dimensionality, or negative sampling, can lead to variations in embedding quality.

### Conclusion:

Evaluating word embeddings can be both direct (intrinsic) and based on their utility in specific applications (extrinsic). While intrinsic evaluations provide insights into the properties of the embeddings themselves, extrinsic evaluations show how well they serve in real-world tasks. Ideally, one should consider both types of evaluations to get a comprehensive understanding of embedding quality.
